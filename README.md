## About me
Hello,

My name is Kuba Krajewski and I am an experienced teacher of English who is willing to take his first steps in the IT world. I would love to join your team. I don't have any commercial experience, but during my learning I have already had the opportunity to conduct some exploratory testing of a number of web pages and report the bugs I found in Jira. I know quite a few tools and I have some tech skills which are necessary for good testing. As for the theory, I know why to test at all, what is the purpose of testing and the principles of testing, what is the difference between functional and non-functional testing, white-box and black-box testing, what is regression testing and what to do when a developer says "but it works for me". I am a highly motivated and open - minded person. I am focused on self - development, learning new tools/ skills and broadening knowledge. Curiosity with the desire to explore, active discovery, attention to detail, professional criticism and a critical eye are some of my assets.  I hope you can give me a chance and I will be able to present myself at an interview.
